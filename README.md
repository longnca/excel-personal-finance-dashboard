# Personal Finance Dashboard in MS Excel 
![GitHub last commit (by committer)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnguyendata/personal-finance-dashboard)

## Project Summary
- As a husband and father, managing personal finances is one of my top priorities. I'm always curious about where my hard-earned money is going and how much I can save each month. That's why I decided to take on a personal finance project using MS Excel 365.
- The goal was to create a dashboard that tracks my income and expenses for the first four months of 2023. By doing this, I could gain valuable insights into my spending habits and make informed decisions about budgeting and saving for the rest of the year. Plus, I wanted to make it fun and interactive by building a dashboard that's easy to use and visually engaging.

## Tools Used:
The skills and techniques I utilized in this project include:
- Data Wrangling in Excel (date/time, IF functions…)
- Pivot Tables
- Slicers
- Advanced Charting
- Conditional Formatting
- Data Manipulations
- Form Controls
- Macros and VBA

## Note
- Certain charts may not appear if the MS Excel version being used is Excel 2016 or an older version.
- Enabling macros is necessary to utilize the functionality of resetting the slicer (the red garbage bin icon on the top right). Don't worry, as a data analyst, I prioritize data security, and I won't cause any harm to your computer. To enable the macros, please follow the instructions [here](https://tinyurl.com/enabling-macros).
- However, if you’re not comfortable enabling macros, then you can use the version without macros.
