## Project Summary
The dashboard provides a brief summary of my income and expenses during the first four months of 2023 using MS Excel 365.
Please visit my [portfolio website](https://www.longnguyendata.com/) for more details.

## Data Preparation:
* To prepare the data, I downloaded my RBC Royal Bank statement and imported it into MS Excel 365.
* After cleaning the data by removing missing data, renaming columns, and formatting data (dates, numbers, text), I created calculated fields for Pivot tables.
* Note that to protect my privacy, I made some changes to the data, such as altering my salary/mortgage numbers and some texts.

## Goal:
* My goal was to design a one-sheet dashboard that tells the whole story at a glance.
* To make it more engaging, I wanted the dashboard to be interactive.

## Key takeaways:
* My savings for the first four months totalled almost $6,000, which is pretty good, considering it doesn’t include my spouse’s finances.
* My biggest expense occurred in April, mainly due to buying a new set of summer tires for my truck, causing my transportation costs to surge.
* The dashboard is highly interactive. You can change the slicers to drill through specific categories or months.
* The dashboard can be updated with any new data added in the coming months, making it a reliable source of information.

## Skills Used:
I utilized the following skills to create this dashboard:

* Pivot Tables
* Slicers
* Advanced Charting
* Conditional Formatting
* Data Manipulations
* Form Controls
* Macros and VBA

## Note
* Certain charts may not appear if the MS Excel version being used is Excel 2016 or an older version.
* Enabling macros is necessary to utilize the function of reseting the slicer (the red garbage bin icon on the top right). Don't worry, as a data analyst, I prioritize data security, and I won't cause any harm to your computer. To enable the macros, please follow the instructions [here](https://tinyurl.com/enabling-macros).
* However, if you’re not comfortable enabling macros, then the dashboard is still interactive except for that red bin icon.
