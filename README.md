# Personal Finance Dashboard in MS Excel 
![GitHub last commit (by committer)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longbytes/personal-finance-dashboard)

## Project Description
- As a husband and father, managing personal finances is one of my top priorities. I'm always curious about where my hard-earned money is going and how much I can save each month. That's why I decided to take on a personal finance project using MS Excel 365.
- The goal was to create a dashboard that tracks my income and expenses for the first four months of 2023. By doing this, I could gain valuable insights into my spending habits and make informed decisions about budgeting and saving for the rest of the year. Plus, I wanted to make it fun and interactive by building a dashboard that's easy to use and visually engaging.

Please visit my [portfolio website](https://www.longnguyendata.com/project/personal-finance-dashboard/) for more details.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is the bank statement downloaded from my RBC Royal Bank account in CSV format.
- For privacy reasons, I made some changes to the data, such as altering my salary/mortgage numbers and some texts.

## Tools Used:
The skills and techniques I utilized in this project include:
- Data Wrangling in Excel (date/time, IF functions…)
- Pivot Tables
- Slicers
- Advanced Charting
- Conditional Formatting
- Data Manipulations
- Form Controls
- Macros and VBA

## How to view the project 
- Download two Excel files (`.xlsx` and `.xlsm`) directly from this GitHub repository. Open them on your computer with MS Excel installed.
- For more information and a video demonstration of navigating the Excel dashboard, visit my [portfolio website](https://www.longnguyendata.com/project/personal-finance-dashboard/).
- Please note that some charts may not appear in Excel 2016 or older versions. I built this dashboard using MS Excel 365 (version updated in April 2023).
- Enabling macros is necessary to utilize the functionality of resetting the slicer (the red garbage bin icon on the top right). Don't worry, as a data analyst, I prioritize data security, and I won't cause any harm to your computer. To enable the macros, please follow the instructions [here](https://tinyurl.com/enabling-macros).
- However, if you’re not comfortable enabling macros, then you can use the version without macros, which is the `.xlsx` file.
- If you have any questions regarding the project, please feel free to contact me.
