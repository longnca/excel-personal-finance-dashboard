## Project Summary
The dashboard provides a brief summary of my income and expenses during the first four months of 2023 using MS Excel 365.
Please visit my [portfolio website](https://www.longnguyendata.com/) for more details.

## Note
* Certain charts may not appear if the MS Excel version being used is Excel 2016 or an older version.
* Enabling macros is necessary to utilize the function of reseting the slicer (the red garbage bin icon on the top right). Don't worry, as a data analyst, I prioritize data security, and I won't cause any harm to your computer. To enable the macros, please follow the instructions [here](https://tinyurl.com/enabling-macros).
* However, if you’re not comfortable enabling macros, then you can use the version without macros.
